        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 2.5em;">Critera</p>

       <div class="container z-depth-5">
        <img src=vrfeatured1.jpg width="400" Height="280px" >
        <p>VR, the first thing that comes to mind is being in a whole new world surrounded by countless possibilities. That is true, however have you sat down and thought of the dangers that VR can cause? Well for starters in order for technology to be considered disruptive, it must meet certain criteria for it to be checked off as true. The criteria is as follows from source #1: 
        <ul class=myUl>
            <li><a>"It must create value for customers by providing them with something they did not previously have access to."</a> </li>
            <li><a>"It must be significantly different from what already exists."</a> </li>
            <li><a>"It must be able to displace established competitors."</a> </li>
            <li><a>"It must create long lasting changes within its respective industry or sector."</a> </li>
           </ul>
        For example, streaming services disrupt traditional television networks by allowing their viewers to access certain content at any time instead of having them wait until specific times to be available. We so not think of that as being disruptive but yet it is. Now you got the basis of it, let's move onto some data.
       
        </p>
        
         </div>
        
        
        
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 2.5em;">Pokemon Go</p>

       <div class="container z-depth-5">
        <img src=istockphoto-899661616-612x612.jpg width="400" Height="280px" >
         <p>
         Our first data leads us into the world of Pokemon Go. I know, strange route to go but stay with me here. Pokemon go is not 1 to 1 Vitriol Reality, but it's another form in the form of Augmentative Reality. Rather than creating a whole virtual world all it does is adds virtual elements to the world around us. You might assume since you can still see what's around you while you're playing augmented reality games, the truth is many people have been injured while using it. From source #2 it states that;
        <ul class=myUl>
        <li><a>"A man who was playing Pokemon Go while he was driving ran into a police car."</a> </li>
        <li><a>"A distracted man was robbed while he was playing Pokemon Go."</a> </li>
        <li><a>"A distracted man was assaulted while he was playing Pokemon Go."</a> </li>
        <li><a>"Two distracted men fell off a cliff when they were walking while playing Pokemon Go."</a> </li>
        <li><a>"A man who was speeding while playing Pokemon Go crashed his car."</a> </li>
        </ul>
        There was also one study in Tippecanoe County, researchers attributed 134 car accidents that included two fatalities to that game. That's terrible, I know. Let's move onto a different game now.
        
        </div>
       
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 2.5em;">Inappropriate Content</p>

        <div class="container z-depth-5">
        <img src=getty_584236800_358604.jpg width="600" Height="350px" >
    <p>
        The next data leads us to some popular apps that 10-year-old are using, that host inappropriate content. Researchers have repeatedly found that it is now easier for minors to access inappropriately violent or sexually graphic things when using Quest headsets. They found even content that is rated ok for 10-year-olds from the Meta Quest app store can be disturbing. "Content that's not developmentally appropriate can be very harmful," said Dr. Bertin, the developmental pediatrician. "You can't unsee things." (Source #3) They tested Meta’s new kid accounts for ages 10-12. These accounts allow the parents to control what apps their child gets, and Meta turns off access to certain age inappropriate apps by default. Those controls sound good at the surface. but not good enough.
        <br><br>
        Playing on a Meta Quest 3 headset as a 10-year-old, the researchers tested out a little game called Rec Room. The app is rated “E for Everyone ages 10 and up” and currently one of the most popular apps available in Meta’s Quest app stores right now. The app quickly recommended that their “10-year-old” play a game of Russian Roulette. That’s not appropriate for kids at the age of 10. The game was with real players sitting around a table in a darkened room, passing a gun around and deciding who to shoot. Within moments, a player sitting across from their virtual 10-year-old shot himself in the head. Folks, that's just the tip of the iceberg.
        <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some other popular apps on Quest headsets can host sexually graphic content. A BBC News researcher using VRChat (a prominent app on Meta’s app store with a minimum age rating of 13) posed as a 13-year-old girl and was able to access virtual strip clubs and explicit rooms where players simulated sex. Another app called Horizon Worlds (Meta’s own social VR app) with minors present in sexually explicit places like; virtual strip clubs, private rooms designed for simulating sexual acts, and bars offering sex toys for players to interact with. These places can be dangerous. They exist so users can interact with each other. Teens exploring or stumbling on these spaces are likely to interact with adult users. Now that’s a scary thought. One thing that they could do is for those places, have an age restriction on it. That’s a easy fix, but no.
        <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing about parents of kids and teens who play online multiplayer video games with chat and voice features that profanity is a common feature in VR games, too. Back to Rec Room, their researcher’s were using a 10-year-old user with a junior account, they managed to stumble upon on bad language. Even with the fact that Rec Room automatically disables audio for junior accounts. Their fake 10-year-old happened to walk by a whiteboard where a player was repeatedly drawing genitalia and the phrase “s*** my d***”.  Unfortunately, hateful speech continues to be an issue in VR multiplayer games as well. The same user at the whiteboard proceeded to write other racially motivated profanity, and someone had already drawn a swastika. You can’t really escape this kind of behavior on any game. It’s bound to happen, but my point is still vailed.
        <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last topic I'm gonna cover in this section is bullying in VR spaces. From their“10-year-old” experienced a bit of disorienting bullying in the majority of the games they played on Rec Room. In the very first game they tried a game called Snipers vs. Runners. Their junior account shook hands with another player, thus becoming friends and able to locate each other inside Rec Room instantly at any point when they were both logged on. After shaking hands, the other player began to slap the junior account player repeatedly, following when they tried to move away. The game began another round, separating them from the other player. The moment the round ended, however, all players were dumped back in the waiting room together, and the same player ran up and began slapping their junior account player again. This went on for three rounds before they had enough. It is not bad per se, but it is annoying nonetheless.

        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 2.5em;">Effects</p>

       <div class="container z-depth-5">

        <p>
        The last source we’re gonna cover is source #4. In this source it talks about some side effects that VR can have on people. The effects include; Motion Sickness, Eyestrain, Headaches, Looking Pale, Sweating, Dry Mouth, A full feeling in your belly, Getting disoriented, Vertigo, Trouble with balance and coordination, Nausea and Vomiting. This might seem all bad, but that’s only if you’re always in it and never take breaks. It can be used to help people. In one study (from source 4), VR eased pain for pregnant women who were in labor. Another found that VR helped children feel less pain and anxiety during a procedure to insert a catheter into a vein. One team of researchers reported that adults who wore VR glasses during a colonoscopy called their virtual experience “pleasant and distracting.” In a study of adults getting painful wound care treatments, those who received VR therapy needed less opioid medication to manage discomfort during the procedures than those who didn’t.
        <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VR can also help in PTSD treatment. Studies suggest VR may help ease post-traumatic stress disorder. It simulates the type of traumatic event you experienced, like combat, a disaster, or a car accident. A review of studies found that VR treatment helped with PTSD and depression symptoms. But the studies were limited because they mainly looked at male military service members. A single study of military veterans and active-duty personnel with combat-related PTSD found that virtual reality sessions, along with other treatments, led to less social isolation, depression, and anger 6 months later. The researchers cautioned that their findings suggest that VR alone isn’t enough to manage PTSD. It’s usually treated with options like talk therapy and medication. VR can also help doctors and student experience practice and lean in a VR space. Doctors can preform surgeries without taking the chance of killing or harming someone.
        <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So is the Metaverse truly disruptive? The answer depends on how you define disruption. If it means completely replacing existing technologies, then no, not yet anyway. Also the fact that if it means providing new ways for people to interact with each other, then yes absolutely! The potential for what can be done within these virtual worlds is limitless, from education and training programs to business meetings and social gatherings, all without ever leaving your home!
